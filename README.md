# Pitch-Roll-LabVIEW
A Virtual Instrument that displays pitch and roll values of MPU6050 using Arduino and LINX

The accelerometer readings of the MPU6050 from the Arduino are fed into LabVIEW via LINX framework and calculates the Roll, Pitch values from those readings.
The readings cross a particular threshold, different actions can be mapped onto it
